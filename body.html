                        </p>
                        <p class="c-g">The pain response exists to protect our bodies from harm. Pain manifests in the
                           brain and is based on multiple variables. Some variables are involved with past experiences
                           and can change intensity, duration, and perception of pain, while other variables are based
                           on how areas away from our brain are receiving information from our environment. Generally
                           speaking, pain is a sign that we should discontinue activity or change our body position to
                           avoid further damage. Most pain signals are temporary and can be remedied with the
                           appropriate intervention.

                        <p class="f-l">Tissue injury or Nociception
                        </p>
                        <p class="c-g">Tissue injury is a local disruption of body tissue that leads to an inflammatory
                           response. This inflammatory response activates local nerves which send signals to our spinal
                           cord and eventually our brain where we experience pain. Most often it is from damage to skin,
                           muscle, tendon, ligament, bone, joint capsule, or nerve if it involves the musculoskeletal or
                           integumentary system. Our organs can also be sources of localized tissue injury or can refer
                           pain to other regions of our body. One way to help determine the source of local tissue
                           injury is to move the affected area and see if it changes what type of pain or the level of
                           pain you are experiencing. Pain at rest is indicative of a prolonged inflammatory response,
                           sub-optimal posture, or can indicate something more serious and should be addressed
                           immediately.

                        </p>
                        <p class="c-g">Chronic pain is a maladaptive response based on the perception of pain for a
                           prolonged period of time: usually defined as 3 months or longer. Chronic pain often begins by
                           local tissue injury and an inflammatory response.
                           <br>
                           As a result, it is common to avoid irritating the injured area and even try to protect it.
                           This behavior reinforces the idea that there is injury, even if the area is physiologically
                           healed. As this type of behavior continues, the area can become hypersensitive to stimuli. As
                           an example, if I bump my elbow and it hurts for a few days, I may carry that arm closer to my
                           body, or use my other arm to protect it to avoid hurting it more. If I do bump it one day by
                           mistake, I will have an intense pain response based on the BELIEF that it is still injured
                           even if that’s not true. If this continues long enough, eventually nerves near the area, and
                           our spinal cord will respond more intensely if the area we believed to be injured is
                           stimulated.
                           <br>
                           Over time, even our brains begin processing pain at a lower level of stimulation, and
                           eventually the area in our brain responsible for that specific body part enlarges. This
                           phenomenon causes us to experience pain in an area without even stimulating it. The biggest
                           issue for people experiencing chronic pain in my experience is that providers don't believe
                           them because local tissue damage is not present. THE PAIN IS REAL. The pain is as real as if
                           there were local tissue damage. It takes conscious disagreement with what you are perceiving
                           to change this type of pain response.

                     </div>

                     <p>Many injuries we’ve seen in the clinic involve muscle imbalance around a joint. This causes
                        either shortening, lengthening or stiffness of involved muscles and can translate into increased
                        compression or force through a joint at, above, or below the area of imbalance. As an example,
                        hip muscles are often implicated in knee pain. Correcting these imbalances and teaching the
                        right muscles when to turn on is a huge part of healing the musculoskeletal system. Below are
                        explanations of some common imbalances.
                     </p>

                     <p>Hip Flexors vs. Abdominals: <span class="c-g">Oftentimes the hip flexor muscles start to work
                           overtime causing
                           shortening and tightness which can put stress on the low back and pelvis. By training
                           abdominals while deactivating hip flexors, you can often reduce back pain. (Link)</span></p>

                     <p>Gluteus Maximus vs. Hamstrings: <span class="c-g">Commonly found in runners, the hamstrings will
                           start to work harder
                           than the glutes or buttocks leading to tightness, shortening, and strain of the hamstrings.
                           Retraining the glutes to fire is hard work, but can relieve stress to your whole lower
                           extremity, and even your low back.</span></p>

                     <p>Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL) vs. Gluteus medius: <span class="c-g">This one is less commonly known
                           but is often a culprit in knee
                           pain, especially involving the kneecap. When the TFL is firing more than the gluteus medius,
                           it can cause poor knee mechanics which increases the compression of the kneecap on your femur
                           (thigh bone) and tibia (bigger lower leg bone). There are many useful exercises to strengthen
                           our gluteus medius.

                           large powerful muscles. They activate more often and more powerfully than is ideal which
                           results in poor positioning of our shoulder blade. Our shoulder blade has over 10 muscles
                           that either attach or originate from it. These muscles become too short or long when our
                           upper trapezius starts working overtime, and cannot contract in a normal way leading to poor
                           shoulder positioning and movement. </span></p>

                              intervention to ensure proper alignment before the healing process begins. A non-displaced
                              fracture has a higher likelihood of healing correctly without surgery but it is important
                              to see an orthopedist in either case.
                              <br>Avulsion fracture: When a muscle contracts so hard it tears the tendon from the bone
                              leading to a small fracture right above or below the tendon insertion.

                        <p>Contusion: <span class="c-g">A bruised muscle usually from direct contact or pressure. There
                              are 2 main forms.
                              <br>
                              Intermuscular: This is damage to muscle cells that are located near the periphery of our 3
                              dimensional muscles. Although usually quite painful, these types of bruises tend to heal
                              as our body has an easier time draining the inflammatory fluids that gather as a result of
                              the healing process.
                              <br>
                              Intramuscular: This type of bruise occurs at a deeper level of our 3 dimensional muscles
                              and poses a greater risk as fluid gathers without an easy way to drain. Pain will often
                              last longer than 4 days. If this area is not “mobilized” or stretched/moved, there is risk
                              of calcification which can be a more painful, long term condition known as myositis
                              ossificans. </span></p>
                        <p>Strain: <span class="c-g">Occurs as a result of too much tension put through muscle fibers
                              causing a small to large rupture of tissue. Strains are often referred to as “tears” and
                              are common when the body is put under stress at a level beyond its tissue tolerance. They
                              can occur in poorly trained to highly trained individuals and will either immediately
                              cause a sharp pain or set in within the following few hours. Using the injured muscle will
                              cause pain making strains fairly easy to identify.</span></p>
                        <p>Grade 1 Strain: <span class="c-g">Microtears of muscle fiber resulting in a local
                              inflammatory process,
                              but no evidence of a “palpable defect” or a divot in the muscle fiber. These usually heal
                              within 2-4 weeks with rest, light stretching, and gradual return to activity. </span></p>
                        <p>Grade 2 Strain: <span class="c-g"> Larger tears to individual muscle fibers that are a part
                              of the muscle belly. This level of damage requires your body to lay down scar tissue to
                              heal the injury, and therefore take 6-12 weeks to heal. Physical Therapy can help ensure
                              proper alignment of scar tissue and light exercise that will not overstress healing
                              tissue.</span></p>
                        <p>Grade 3 Strain: <span class="c-g">Complete rupture of muscle fiber. There is a palpable
                              defect or divot where the fibers were separated.This is more serious and usually takes 12
                              weeks to 6 months to heal. There is significant pain with any contraction of the muscle,
                              loss of strength and swelling. Scar tissue lays down to heal the ruptured area. These
                              injuries should be examined and treated by a doctor or physical therapist to facilitate
                              healthy healing and return to normal activity. These may require surgery.</span></p>
                        <p>Muscle Tightness: <span class="c-g">usually a sensation of stiffness that can lead to a
                              decrease in range of motion. It is most often the result of muscle imbalance but can also

                              increased stress on the tissue. Tendinitis requires rest and specific types of muscle
                              contractions to heal with gradual increase in resistance below the threshold of pain. A
                              normal tendinitis should get better within 4-8 weeks.

                        <p class="c-g">Foam rolling is an effective technique used to decrease tissue “tightness” or
                           density. It can be used before or after activity and will likely cause some discomfort in the
                           muscle you are rolling. In this case, pain is an indicator of an area where you need to focus
                           the pressure to decrease the density of those fibers, thereby allowing the muscle to become
                           more pliable.

                        <p class="c-g">The quadriceps are a group of 4 large thick muscles that support us in standing,
                           stair climbing, sit to stand transitions, and getting up from the floor. It is important to
                           rotate your feet inward and outward to make sure you are applying pressure to the full muscle

                           under the glutes that can get tight or shortened and cause pain in our buttocks, low back,

                           They are often very painful to foam roll, as they get overworked and develop “knots” or areas
